# javaScript API Integration 🏆

**The ECMAScript module system is a standardized way of organizing and structuring code in JavaScript applications. It allows developers to create reusable pieces of code (modules) that can be imported and used in other parts of their applications. ECMAScript modules were introduced as part of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) to address the need for a more scalable and modular approach to JavaScript development.**
